            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>SOrrow may endure for a night, but Joy cometh in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, (saith the Musicall King and Prophet.) <hi>England</hi> hath had a long night of sorrow, the Sun of her glory (which was wont to ejaculate the splendent rays of opulent magnificency, through all knowne Lands) hath of late years been so eclipsed, that all her former lustre hath been involv'd in Cymerian dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the glittering of her owne unnaturall Sword did so dazell her (purblind) eyes, that she could not see his own miserable state, and precipitation unto utter ruine: nor move her hand to retex that unnaturall cord which tyes her fast to destruction.</p>
            <p>To reiterate the story of <hi>Englands</hi> late condition, would not be sutable to my present discourse, for my theme is joy, and as I am a most joyfull Subject my selfe, by the nourishing of my hopes, I desire to excite others, by this subject of joy to be joyfull Subjects too. Give way thou sable night of sorrow to this illustrious morning of joy: <hi>Aurora</hi> is risen in the East, and the Northern Star is become our <hi>Hyperion:</hi> the tenebrous Clouds which did invelop our happinesse, are dissipated by the approaching splendor of the Sun. Briefly, he whom we for a long time sought, and for whom we have sighed, sobbed, wept, prayed, fasted, I and fought too, to gain, that is, our most gracious and truly dread Soveraigne Gods anointed King <hi>Charles,</hi> is now by divine motion, with peace and joy, with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity and affection, after so long absence, coming to capitulate with his great Councell the Parliament, concerning our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady and cure; to expresse this generall exultation in it's true dimensions, let us forme in our fantasie the Idea of the Tribes of Israel when they came to Hebron 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.1. to choose <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> for their King, after the death of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:164837:3"/> Loyall Subjects; Such congratulations, or the like, doth Royall <hi>Charles</hi> with in his Princely Journall; yet there are in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> too many Jebusits that will say to King <hi>Charles</hi> as those did to K. <hi>David, v.</hi> 6. <hi>unlesse thou take away the lame and the blind thou shalt not come hither,</hi> these lame judgements and blind af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, cause them as they do so misconstrue his Royall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, making a Mountain of every mole-hill of his imperfections; but a religious <hi>David</hi> must expect a gracelesse <hi>Shemei</hi> to curse him and to call him bloody man, and man of <hi>Beliall,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam</hi> 7. but on the contrary, all true hearted Subjects will raise up a loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all strife, and stir up a zealous contention among themselves; who shall have the most or first place or part, in bringing the King home to his house, and I doubt not but many good and gratefull men, remembring old grace, and favours, will like <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> and <hi>Barzilai,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.22.23. meet their long absent Soveraign with contratulary entertainments and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of extraordinary Joy, for his return.</p>
            <p>Come then beloved King unto thy beloved people, make glad the places of thy Royall presence, and while thou abidest in one place, maist thou be with longing desire wish'd for in all places of thy Kingdome; may thy Subjects flow to the Sea of thy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues as small rivers to the maine Ocean, and like faithfull Bees, let them bring sweet honey of obedience unto the just hive of thy protection. Let them in the softest hearts hatch the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and let their tongues sing of thy honor. Let thy Adaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine goodnesse draw the iron hearts of those that are refractory unto their duty. Let them be turned back and put to confusion that seek thy hurt, <hi>Psal.</hi> 70.2. Let these be the reward of thine adversaries from the Lord, and of them that speak evill against thy Soule, <hi>Psal.</hi> 109.10. <hi>Let thy heart be sound in the Statutes of the Lord, and enter thou with thy people, into the Covenant of the Lord,</hi> Deut. 2.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 1. Rev. 2.3. <hi>Let thy Princely Sons be as plants up in their youth,</hi> Psal. 143.12. <hi>Let thy Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be as stones polished after the similitude of a Palace. Let all thine enemies be cloathed with shame, but upon thy Royall head let thy Crowne flourish,</hi> Psal. 132.18. <hi>Let Peace be in all thy Lands, and plenty in all thy borders, let England (Gods Israel) rejoyce in their maker, and let the children of Zion rejoyce in their King,</hi> Psal.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:164837:3"/> 89.36. <hi>Let thy seed endure for ever, and thy throne as the Sun before God. Let not the foot of Pride come against thee, and let not the hand of the wicked remove thee,</hi> Psal. 36.11. <hi>Let not them that are thine Enemies rejoyce over thee, neither let them wink with the eye that hate thee without a cause.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yea, let them say continually, let the Lord be magnified, which hath pleasure in the posterity of his servant. Let thy trust (ô my King) be in the Lord, and through the mercy of the most high, thou shalt not be moved,</hi> Psal. 21.7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let thy daies be as the daies of heaven, and let thy seed be as the Stars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let all mistakings, jealousies, and misconstruction between thee and thy People be moved as far as the East is from the West, or he North from the South.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let thine eares be attentive to heare the sound advice of thy People, and let thine heart incline to the wholsome admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of thy great and grave Counsell the two Houses of Parliament.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let all faction and pertakings be laid aside, and let charity and unity bind thee and thy People firmely together.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Let thy exemplary conversation convert or confound all thine enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let them all be ashamed who have spoken evill against thy sacred Majesty, when the universall eye shall see (and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge) all thy actions to be grounded upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of grace and goodnesse, and thy innocency purge
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:164837:4"/> thee from all infamous and treacherous Calumnies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let thy Piety and Zeale towards God and his Church make all Hereticks, Shismaticks and blinded Sectaries recant their damnable opinions, and returne to their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of God, and his true Church, and of thee their lawfull King and the annointed of God.</p>
            <p>These humble admonitions, (and hearty wishes most gracious and dread Soveraigne) our Loyall Subjects present unto your Royall Majesty: not that they deem your Grace, to want divine endocuments, (having been alwaies taught and led by the spirit of truth) but to shew their inward zeale to your Highnesses happinesse, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and safety: For out of the abundance of the heart the tongue speaketh (saith the author of truth) and now gentle Readers (and Christian Country-men) I have spoken as is weake to the Kings Majesty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p>Many of his Majesties old Servants are come to read-minister their duty and service unto him their Soveraign master, and 'tis too probably conjectured that all our former clouds of sorrow and discontent shall soon be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled by the beams of benignity on both sides, either party inclining to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> counsell, are willing to bear one anothers burden, and the Sea of <hi>Love</hi> which covers a multitude of sins shall drowne all State grudges. The King shall comply with his Parliament, the Parliament agree with the King, the People in generall shall yeeld to <hi>Caesar</hi> his due, and <hi>Caesar</hi> (as he hath been) shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a gracious Soveraigne to them.</p>
            <p>Briefly, The Kingdome shall have Peace and Truth, the Churches Uniformity, and Concord almost quite lost, <hi>Ireland</hi> hopes of a speedy reduction, Sectaries and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:164837:4"/> Blasphemers shall be bridled (if not extirpated) and Church Government with true Religion established. God grant it may, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now I think on't I should do evill in omission of one thing very well worthy of recitall, which is this; Since his Sacred Majesty was first delivered by the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Commissioners to our English Lords, a various ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour hath been whispered by <hi>vox populi</hi> as what they mean to do with the King, and though life, words (and thoughts) of some being nourished by Loyall fear, and of others by fantasie, but my conclusion shall be with the confidence that I have in the reality, [and integrity] of the Parliament, whose serious Protestations, (both Vocal and Literall) have so often promis'd to the world, that not an haire of his Royall head shall perish, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hurt betyde his Sacred Person, which lies in their power to anticipate, but on the contrary that they will rather adde to, then substract from him any of (either) his just Prerogatives or Revenues, making him a greater Monarch then before, either he or any of his Ancestors or Predecessors, were this if it be certain (as question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it is) we shall (by Gods gracious permission) see very suddenly, that the King shall rejoyce in God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63.11. who sweare by him shall have glory, for the mouths (of evill speakers or) them that speak lies shall be stopped, <hi>Amen.</hi>
